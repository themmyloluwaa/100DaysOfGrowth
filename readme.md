## 100 Days of Growth

This repository contains a report (code, text, images etc) of my summer learnings around, DSA K8s, Typescript, AWS, Linux and other technologies. It is my hope that At the end of this 100 days, I have a better understanding of these concepts and I have grown as an overall engineer ready to solve complex and simple problems.

### Day 1

- I refreshed my understanding of basic types in typescript and learnt about Alias, Tuple and Interfaces.
- I also tried starting the AWS beginner course on freecodecamp but unfortunately my account isn't fully activated.

### Day 2

- I restarted my DSA journey by reading the CSD book, chapter 1 and 2 on Foundations for computer science and Time complexity. I found it difficult to relate well with the mathematical concepts in chapter 1 but I realise this is something I'd often need to go back to.
- I also started my linux learnings by taking some lessons the [LinuxJourney](linuxjourney.com) course where I learnt some new shell commands like cut, wc, expand, tail, head etc
- I finally got my AWS account setup and started my cloud learnings. I created a billing alarm using cloudwatch and explored the IAM service by creating a new group, a new user and assigning policies. I also learnt about VPC although i found that really hard to grasp most especially the public subnet and private subnets. I learnt about stateless firewalls (Network ACLs) and stateful firewalls (Security groups). I am confident that the section on VPC, firewalls, endpoints etc are sections I would need to devote more time to learning. Finally, I learnt about the public services available in AWS and the private ones too.

### Day 3

- I read the algorithms and data structures section of touch of class and i tried implementing some operations (queries and commands) by creating an Array class in python.
- I also learnt some k8s related stuffs like cronjobs, jobs object, the generators, uses of labels and annotations.
- It was a quiet day with regards learning but I am getting comfortable with the fact that it isn't about how long i spend learning but the consistency i build overtime.

### Day 4

- I started the day feeling a bit sad and down because I felt lost watching a course on Kubernetes. It wasn't because i didn't understand the content of the course, but because it feels like i keep on learning the same thing over and over again without any direction. What do i need to learn to prove to a potential employer that I am skilled in the devops field ?

- I resolved this conflict by listing out things i'd like to give a try out and take a simple app from bare minimum to being deployed on a k8s cluster

- I also continued reading the touch of class book on data structures and I was able to complete my learning on Array. The custom array class i created works well and it has other features such as sorting, reversing etc. These custom methods were implemented by me and it was really a great way to learn how to solve some problems and how the array data structure works under the hood.

- I continued reading the CSD book and started chapter 3 on algorithmic strategies. I learnt about iteration today and i implemented a sorting algorithm to merge two sorted list together in linear time.

### Day 5

- I started my day with AWS where I learnt how to create instances, setup autoscaling groups based on resource metrics and also started the load balancer aspect. I learnt how to startup an EC2 instance and connect to it. I also learnt about giving services roles to access other AWS services

- I continued my DSA learnings by watching CS dojo's short videos on DSA. About 3 of them. I continued my learning on arrays by solving two leetcode challenges, one hard and one simple. I had previously solved these challenges using Javascript but I rewrote them in python and I saw massive improvement in how I approached the problems.

- Lastly I learnt about linux permissions, users, and how to add user, remove user, modify permission of files etc. I would be refreshing my learnings on this for **day 6** as these are really new concepts.

### Day 6

- I started the day by sketching out plans for my portolio. I do think I have a great starting point and I will gradually iterate the sketches and translate them to designs on figma. I will also need to hire an animator and graphic designer and probably also pay for some hosting and domain name.

- I continued my learnings by boostrapping a simple nodejs project which would serve as the foundation forexploring k8s in practice.

- I also continued my DSA learnings by refreshing my understanding of recursion and iteration using the CSD book. I am still working on Arrays and I solved two more problems on leetcode today.

- I watched a talk titled [It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY). It was a great talk on how to handle imposter syndrome and getting increasing positivity.
