## 100 Days of Growth

This repository contains a report (code, text, images etc) of my summer learnings around, DSA K8s, Typescript, AWS, Linux and other technologies. It is my hope that At the end of this 100 days, I have a better understanding of these concepts and I have grown as an overall engineer ready to solve complex and simple problems.

### Day 1

- I refreshed my understanding of basic types in typescript and learnt about Alias, Tuple and Interfaces.
- I also tried starting the AWS beginner course on freecodecamp but unfortunately my account isn't fully activated.

### Day 2

- I restarted my DSA journey by reading the CSD book, chapter 1 and 2 on Foundations for computer science and Time complexity. I found it difficult to relate well with the mathematical concepts in chapter 1 but I realise this is something I'd often need to go back to.
- I also started my linux learnings by taking some lessons the [LinuxJourney](linuxjourney.com) course where I learnt some new shell commands like cut, wc, expand, tail, head etc
- I finally got my AWS account setup and started my cloud learnings. I created a billing alarm using cloudwatch and explored the IAM service by creating a new group, a new user and assigning policies. I also learnt about VPC although i found that really hard to grasp most especially the public subnet and private subnets. I learnt about stateless firewalls (Network ACLs) and stateful firewalls (Security groups). I am confident that the section on VPC, firewalls, endpoints etc are sections I would need to devote more time to learning. Finally, I learnt about the public services available in AWS and the private ones too.

### Day 3

- I read the algorithms and data structures section of touch of class and i tried implementing some operations (queries and commands) by creating an Array class in python.
- I also learnt some k8s related stuffs like cronjobs, jobs object, the generators, uses of labels and annotations.
- It was a quiet day with regards learning but I am getting comfortable with the fact that it isn't about how long i spend learning but the consistency i build overtime.
