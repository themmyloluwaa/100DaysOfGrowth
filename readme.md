## 100 Days of Growth

This repository contains a report (code, text, images etc) of my summer learnings around, DSA K8s, Typescript, AWS, Linux and other technologies. It is my hope that At the end of this 100 days, I have a better understanding of these concepts and I have grown as an overall engineer ready to solve complex and simple problems.

### Day 1

- I refreshed my understanding of basic types in typescript and learnt about Alias, Tuple and Interfaces.
- I also tried starting the AWS beginner course on freecodecamp but unfortunately my account isn't fully activated.

### Day 2

- I restarted my DSA journey by reading the CSD book, chapter 1 and 2 on Foundations for computer science and Time complexity. I found it difficult to relate well with the mathematical concepts in chapter 1 but I realise this is something I'd often need to go back to.
- I also started my linux learnings by taking some lessons the [LinuxJourney](linuxjourney.com) course where I learnt some new shell commands like cut, wc, expand, tail, head etc
- I finally got my AWS account setup and started my cloud learnings. I created a billing alarm using cloudwatch and explored the IAM service by creating a new group, a new user and assigning policies. I also learnt about VPC although i found that really hard to grasp most especially the public subnet and private subnets. I learnt about stateless firewalls (Network ACLs) and stateful firewalls (Security groups). I am confident that the section on VPC, firewalls, endpoints etc are sections I would need to devote more time to learning. Finally, I learnt about the public services available in AWS and the private ones too.

### Day 3

- I read the algorithms and data structures section of touch of class and i tried implementing some operations (queries and commands) by creating an Array class in python.
- I also learnt some k8s related stuffs like cronjobs, jobs object, the generators, uses of labels and annotations.
- It was a quiet day with regards learning but I am getting comfortable with the fact that it isn't about how long i spend learning but the consistency i build overtime.

### Day 4

- I started the day feeling a bit sad and down because I felt lost watching a course on Kubernetes. It wasn't because i didn't understand the content of the course, but because it feels like i keep on learning the same thing over and over again without any direction. What do i need to learn to prove to a potential employer that I am skilled in the devops field ?

- I resolved this conflict by listing out things i'd like to give a try out and take a simple app from bare minimum to being deployed on a k8s cluster

- I also continued reading the touch of class book on data structures and I was able to complete my learning on Array. The custom array class i created works well and it has other features such as sorting, reversing etc. These custom methods were implemented by me and it was really a great way to learn how to solve some problems and how the array data structure works under the hood.

- I continued reading the CSD book and started chapter 3 on algorithmic strategies. I learnt about iteration today and i implemented a sorting algorithm to merge two sorted list together in linear time.

### Day 5

- I started my day with AWS where I learnt how to create instances, setup autoscaling groups based on resource metrics and also started the load balancer aspect. I learnt how to startup an EC2 instance and connect to it. I also learnt about giving services roles to access other AWS services

- I continued my DSA learnings by watching CS dojo's short videos on DSA. About 3 of them. I continued my learning on arrays by solving two leetcode challenges, one hard and one simple. I had previously solved these challenges using Javascript but I rewrote them in python and I saw massive improvement in how I approached the problems.

- Lastly I learnt about linux permissions, users, and how to add user, remove user, modify permission of files etc. I would be refreshing my learnings on this for **day 6** as these are really new concepts.

### Day 6

- I started the day by sketching out plans for my portolio. I do think I have a great starting point and I will gradually iterate the sketches and translate them to designs on figma. I will also need to hire an animator and graphic designer and probably also pay for some hosting and domain name.

- I continued my learnings by boostrapping a simple nodejs project which would serve as the foundation forexploring k8s in practice.

- I also continued my DSA learnings by refreshing my understanding of recursion and iteration using the CSD book. I am still working on Arrays and I solved two more problems on leetcode today.

- I watched a talk titled [It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY). It was a great talk on how to handle imposter syndrome and getting increasing positivity.

- Lastly, I refreshed the linux learnings of yesterday on user management, permissions and learnt something new again.

### Day 7

- Started the day by setting up the testing environment for the Trivia App.
- Went through Algorithms and practiced 3 leetcode challenges. Found it difficult to understand the 3Sum Closest solution but I will keep cracking at it. I also looked at backtracing algorithm and started to learn about the Heuristic approach to solving problems.

### Day 8

- I started the day with a walk to the Rheinfall. I believe exercising should be part of an Engineer's fire arms in being world class.

- I continued writing test for the trivia app. For the first time, writing tests in react native gave me an amazing experience. I hope it continues this way.

- Concludeded the day by continuing typescript learning and working on a small project called maps

### Day 9

- Solved two leetcode challenges on reversing a linked list and also checking if a linked list is a palindrome.
- Learnt about packages and processes in linkux
- Read the computer science distilled book on data types and structures. I had to skip the strategy chapter because it was too complicated. It's a chapter I would often visit.
- Finished up the triviaApp and submitted it. I'm scheduled for an interview on Thur.

### Day 10

- Built a Quiz Application using React + Typescript to help solidify typescript learnings and to also serve as the project that would be used for the k8s learnings.
- Continued my DSA learnings by revising some algorithms I had solved in the past. I hope if given these problems, I can remeber how to solve them.

### Day 11

- I continued on my AWS learning path where I learnt about the elastic load balancer, the 3 different types of storage we have in AWS, block store, file storage and object store. I also carried out practical demos on them by starting up different instances and attaching the block and file storage to them.
- I learnt about dynamic programming and how to apply it to the Knapsack problem. I first learnt about the exponential recursive way to solve it and how to improve it to O(nlogn) time complexity using dynamic programming.
- Finally I learnt about insertion sort and started learning about merge sort.

### Day 12

### Day 28

- I had my first dose of the vaccine today so I wasn't able to do much but I worked on my linkedin profile, applied to a few jobs.
- I also read up on the various ways of aggregating data in a microservice architecture sytle that uses the DB per service pattern. Again, there's always a trade off with every decision made in software engineering and what I could pick from these solutions is they all have their advantage and disadvantages, you chose your demon and you manage it.

### Day 29

- I created an organization, project, team and repository on github for the microservice project i'm starting with 3 other colleagues.
- I built a hulu clone using nextjs, tailwindcss and deployed to vercel. The goal of this project was to play with nextjs and tailwindcss. Find it here [Hulu](https://hulu-theta-murex.vercel.app/)

### Day 30

- I solved 3 algorithm questions and learnt that the time complexity of your algorithms is influenced by the choice of data structures and the operation on the inputs in the data structures.

- I finished up the linux basics for hackers book and learnt so much about the linux kernel, working with the terminal and even some scripting using python and bash

- I continued learning about #kubernetes and learnt about the steps involved in setting up a high availability cluster on nodes. I have to say, the work these cloud providers do with helping you setup a control plane is underappreciated.

- I also learnt about node draining in kubernetes
