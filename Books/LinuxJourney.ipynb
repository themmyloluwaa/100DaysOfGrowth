    "- you can also modify permissions using numbers. 4 represents read, 2 represent write and 1 represent execute. Example, `chmod 755 myFile` gives the file all permissions for user, read and execute for both group and other permissions.\n",

    "- you can do both by using a `<user>:<group> in the` `chown` command\n",
    "- The set user id (SUID) allows a user to run a program as the owner of the program rather than themselves. You can give a user SUID permission using `sudo chmod u+s file` or `sudo chmod 4755 file`\n",
    "- The set group id (SGID) allows a program to run as if it was a member of that group.  You can set a SGID permission using `sudo chmod g+s file` or `sudo chmod 2755 file`\n",
    "- The sticky t permission is used to ensure that only the root user or the owner of the file or directory can modify or delete it. You can enable sticky permission by running `sudo chmod +t file/dir` or `sudo chmod 1755 file/dir`\n",
