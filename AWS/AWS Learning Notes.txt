Amazon virtual private cloud (VPC)
This is a virtual space on the cloud in which resources can be launched. It is a logically isolated portion of the AWS cloud within a region.
   


CIDR - classless interdomain routing takes the master address and creates separate address blocks in the range of the master address block for different subnets in the availability zones in the VPC.


Security groups and network access control list
These are types of firewall that can be used to restrict acces to resources in AWS. security groups apply at the instance level in any subnet while NACLs apply at the subnet level.


Stateful firewalls allows the return traffic automatically. It doesn’t need further rules to allow inbound and outbound traffic. Security group in AWS are stateful firewalls
Stateless firewalls checks for an allow rule for both connection between the destination and source computers. Network ACL are stateless firewalls


  



AWS Public and Private Services
Some services in AWS have public IP addresses and endpoints by default. Services like 
* Amazon DynamoDB
* Amazon S3
* Route 53
* CloudFront
While other services can have public IP addresses but exist within the VPC. Anything that needs to be accessed from these VPCs can be access through the internet gateway or VPC endpoints which enable connecting to the public services privately.
